# CashInfinitec 📱

CashInfinitec is a mobile app developed during a college project focused on business modeling and requirements analysis. Our startup proposal aligns with multiple UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). After the prototyping phase in Figma, I decided to independently develop the mobile application using React Native with Expo.

## 🚀 Tech Stack

- Expo 53
- Expo Router
- NativeWind
- React Hook Form
- Zod
- TypeScript

## ✨ Features

- Modern navigation with `expo-router`
- Fully typed with TypeScript
- Form validation using `React Hook Form` + `Zod`
- Utility-first styling with `NativeWind`
- Component-based, scalable architecture
- Based on a real business model with structured requirements

## 🗺️ Project Context

This project was born from an academic initiative where my team designed a startup from the ground up. We followed a full requirements engineering process, including:

- SWOT + 5W2H
- Business Model Canvas
- BPMN diagrams (uml)
- Use Case diagrams (UML)
- Requirement specifications
- Medium-high fidelity Figma prototypes

The mobile app was developed independently based on these deliverables.

## 🏗️ Project Status

⚠️ This app is just a prototype and was created for educational purposes only. No backend or production builds were made.

## 🤝 Contributions
